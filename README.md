- CSS Grid
- [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

This is my first website using **Bootstrap** and problem faced while using this that I can't customize css and when I am about to, then its overwrite. I couldn't get design mobile view also.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me for CSS framework. I liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
